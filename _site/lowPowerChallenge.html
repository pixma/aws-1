<li>To run our system for long time such as 3-5 years without touching the power sources whatever they are.

<li>Battery

<li>Alkaline.</li>

<li>AA+ - Ni-MH.</li>

<li>AAA Battery.</li>

<li>Lipo Battery.</li>

<li>Solar panel as power source.</li>

</li>

<li>To run any digital system for so long, what factors should support
<ul>
<li>Battery or say power source self-discharge rate should be as low as possible.</li>

<li>Current consumption by the digital system should be as much low as possible.</li>

<li>Let digital system should use power only when required.</li>

<li>Use low power or ultra-low power components on circuit.</li>

<li>Place lesser components on board so only essential components will draw current.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Lets go for some calculations
<ul>
<li>consider for 3 years.</li>

<li>which is equals to 3 x 365 x 24 = 26289 Hrs.</li>

<li>consider AA+ battery with current capacity of 2500mAH, rechargable battery suppose.</li>

<li>Slef Discharge rate: 2 - 3 percentage, per month. That is, by self discharging rate of 2 percentage, battery discharge by 50 mA per month.</li>

<li>Scenario :-</li>

<li>Net Current consumption by digital system if kept lower than self dischargeing rate then consider these calculations again:</li>

<li>Suppose Net current consumption is 30mA.</li>

<li>This battery will run for 2500mA / 30 mA is equals to 83.3 Hrs.</li>

<li>Recharge the battery as it reaches down by 10 percent.</li>

<li>Then again it runs for 83.3 Hrs.</li>

<li>This makes 26289 / 83.3 Hrs equals to 316 times recharging.</li>

<li>Also, battery also takes time for charging and at same time it also powers up the digital system.</li>

<li>Above calculation is based on ideal conditions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We need to detect battery voltage level.</li>

<li>We need to protect from over charging and also avoid under charging.</li>
