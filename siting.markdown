## Temperature

The sensor measuring temperature should be open to wind and try to measure atmospheric temperature.

- should be open to wind (good wind circulation)
- screen from sun and rain
- Mount away from possible sources of radiation, like walls, hedges and trees (at least 25 cm away from concrete/radiation sources)
- should be housed in an open area clear from obstructions
- vertical gradients matter. Ideally sensor should be 1.25M above ground level. (rooftops may not have accurate reading)
- screen should be above loose soil/grass but not packed soil or concrete.


The stevenson Screen should be over grass or loose soil but never on top of packed soil or concrete. The 
screen should be away from anything absorbing solar radiation.(at least 25cm away from concrete and other 
radiation sources)


## Rain

Rain gauge should catch over a large area.

1. Keep away from obstructions 
2. Do not mess the airflow
3. Rain gauge should not be in a Rain shadow area
4. Distance from obstructions should be greater than 2 times height of such objects
5. Minimize ground effect turbulent flows(?)

3. Rain gauge should be on level - measure with spirit Gauge

## Pressure

Pressure may be affected by gusts of wind. The Stevenson screen mouting should be tested for wind gusts
 
## Humidity

1. Lot of errors (5% is common)
2. Best is to calibrate against some standard equipment. A better check can be made around the middle of 
a breezy day by comparing readings with a neighbouring calibrated station
3. Sensor should measure extreme conditions (very dry days, very humid days)

## Site Inspection

Things to do on site.

- Carry a camera.
- Compliance with siting constraints.
- Read Davis 7852 Rain gauge manual for mounting it.
- Fabrication for mast pole.
- How to install the mast pole?
- Fabrication for rain gauge holder.
	- Drainage shouldn't be blocked.
	- Should be on a level.
	- Should be kept clear from all obstacles.
	- Read the manual for installing rain guage.
- Clamping for Electric enclosure.
- Cover over electric enclosure.
- inlet outlet for 
	- DHT22 wire.
	- GSM antenna.
	- Power adapter.
	- RJ11 jack for rain gauge.
- Wire should be waterproof.
- Clamping for stevenson screen.
- Constrants should be re-checked.
- Look for Area best suited for Planting stevenson screen.
- Power supply.
- Clamping methods.
- Rain gauge platform.
- Clamping and box Clamping, look on the pole.

##Condition of the area
- Tree, cable lines, syntax platform, high story buildingsas obstacle for breeze.
- No power source option on terrace.
- Open and large area with cemented floor.

##Recommended area
- Place pole on the L corner of the wall rail.
- Place the pole on opposite side from where the tree are there.
- In this picture on this page, the L corner is duitable for clamping the pole.
- As, we cannot pithc our pole on terrace floor, we have to clamp our pole with wall rail.
- Power line will be coming from inside of house.
- We have to cover up the wire for protection.
- Many morepictures are there in galary where you can see the short pipes are clammped.

- Design
	- Total height 9 ft.
	- Each pole 3 ft.
	- joint with Flanges.
	- Poles will be of good quality PVC pipes.
	- Pipes are of white colors, it is.
	- No stand.
	- Have to fix with wall rail.
