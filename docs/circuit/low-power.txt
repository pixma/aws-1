31) power circuit on batteries
Assuming 2200 mAh
40mA
backup = 2200/40 = 55 hours

+ How can we make a pack of batteries?
+ what kind of batteries are available?
	- AA
	- 9V is not recommended
	- LR123
	- LiPo
	- Li-ion batteries?

+ How to wire a backup battery with a DC adapter?
+ voltage regulator - why? what is wrong with on-board regulator?
	- switching regulator instead of a linear one
	- can we drive the board at lower voltages!
	- LTC3525 regulator

+ current draw in different sleep modes
	SLEEP_MODE_IDLE - for USART interrupts

+ How to wake it up from sleep mode?
	- external interrupts on INT0 and INT1
	- watchdog WDT
	- external RTC chip alarm
	- what is TWI match?
	- @imp when ISR is happening - execution of 
	internal timers is suspended.

	SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN
		- watchdog timer interrupt
		- level interrupt on pin2/pin3
			+ pin has to be held in that state for a 
			 certain amount of time before the INT is triggered
			+ The ISR routine for a level interrupt must detach the 
	          interrupt otherwise the ISR will be repeatedly called
				(see Arduino sleepCode for example of how to do that)

+ avr functions
	cli()
	sei()
	set_sleep_mode
	sleep_cpu
	sleep_bod_disable
	sleep_enable
	sleep_disable

	Arduino Brownout detector (BOD) module


+ Turn off what is not used?
 (only needed when we are using SLEEP_MODE_IDLE)
 http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__power.html
	power_adc_disable();
	power_spi_disable();
	power_timer0_disable();
	power_timer1_disable();
	power_timer2_disable();
	power_twi_disable()


+ How to ensure it can reboot itself when hung?
+ Solar panel in the mix
	- How can we switch between solar panel and battery backup?
	
+ How to turn off the peripheral (GSM modem)?
	- MCU should wake up and boot GSM modem
	- SIM900 can be turned OFF using AT commands
		+ However the issue is voltage regulator
		+ Linear voltage regulators would draw power
		+ Either we insert a new voltage regulator
			or power the GSM modem directly from LiPo battery.
		+ what is the power rating? send a mail to simplelabs.co.in
			- How to power a GSM modem directly from battery?
			- LSH-20 D Lithium Battery (30$ a pop) 
				+ can provide high current
	- ATE0 command to turn off Echo mode.
	
+ Rocketscreem low power library - do we need to use that? 

+ Tradeoffs involved in the  board
	- Uno kind of board with 7805 voltage regulator will need 10mA in idle mode
		(Uno draws 34mA in power down mode)
	- Pro boards need a bigger kit to program/transfer
	- Remove the 7805 regulator when you are on batteries!
	- why cannot we use something like a RBBB or Arduino Mini
		+ we have quite a number of peripherals
		+ we have to see the required number of pins.
			
			- sensors (DHT22/BMP085)
			- GSM modem
			- RTC chip (1.5 mA)
			- LCD
			- SD card for data logging?

	- Transferring programs/ interfacing would be tough!
	- Alternative - design a custom power supply!
	- Getting boards in India is a tough ask!
	- MSP430 does not look very tempting as compared to Arduino RBBB
+ Can we use Energia and MSP430?
	- what is MSP430 power consumption?

+ How to measure the current used by MCU?
+ wakeup time of Arduino UNO MCU?
+ How can we ensure that Arduino reboots on software hang?


+ Strategy #1
	- use a BareBonesBoard for Arduino
	- use rocketscream low power library
	- use watchdog timer to wake up
	- go into power down mode
	- 1 second pulse - use counter 
	(how long does it take for Arduino to become functional again?)
	- After certain ticks (say 600 or 10 min. interval)
	- with 4 second pulses - 300 pulses = 20 minute
		we can use rollup counter to count even more
		integer limits?	
	- get rid of the Time and TimerAlarm libraries
	- use Adafruit/JeeLab RTC library for DS1307 
		(w/o dependency on Time library)
	- pin2_isr()
		Rain gauge should wake it up
		Use a pushbutton right now


- strategy #2
	- Use Energia and MSP430 and port the aws sketch
	- Please Beware that msp430 has only 16KB!
		+ Watchdog timer
		+ DS1307 (Wire library)
		+ GSM modem interfacing (Serial)
		+ DHT22
		+ BMP085 (I2C)
		+ SD card?
